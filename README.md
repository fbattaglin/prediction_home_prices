# prediction_home_prices
My task is to develop a model to predict the selling price of a given home in Ames, Iowa. We hope to use this information to help assess whether the asking price of a house is higher or lower than the true value of the house. If the home is undervalued, it may be a good investment for the firm.

In order to complete this task, I will use Bayesian Modeling and RStudio.

The results can be downloaded as a HTLM file in the repository.
